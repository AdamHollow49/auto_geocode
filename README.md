# auto_geocode
Automatically geocodes addresses from a list of street names and numbers. Providing full street name, postcode, county and country.

# How To:
Simply create a list of comma separated address values, like so:

##'10 Main Street', '24 High Street', '19 Paterson Street'

Save this list in the .txt file named "addresses.txt".

Run 'postcodes.py' and you will be asked to apply a single criteria to your search in order to narrow the scope of the search.

##This can be the first half of a postcode: 'KA', 'PA', 'G12', 'D12'

Afterwards, you will be asked for confirmation that the file "addresses.txt" has your comma separated list inserted and saved.

Type 'y' and press enter, after the script is complete, the information can be located in 'addresses_info.txt' in the same order of input.
